# Critical Safety Warning: Chord Hugo 2 Uncontrolled Volume Surge

## Summary

This report documents a severe recurring firmware/hardware malfunction in the **Chord Hugo 2** DAC/Amp that causes the output volume to instantaneously jump to the maximum level (**White color indicator**) without user intervention. This issue can lead to permanent acoustic trauma.

## Short Incident Description

- **Hardware:** Chord Hugo 2, original owner, unit never opened or serviced. Firmware, if it exists, has not been ever flushed (not available on manufacturers site as well)
- **Context:** Desktop mode, connected via USB in a stable indoor environment.
- **The Bug:** The device overrides volume settings, ramping from low volume to 100% (White).
- **Observation:** During the first occurrence, the volume wheel was seen changing colors while was not touched physically.
- **Second Incident:** Occurred while I was away from the computer (brushing teeth); the device was found at 100% volume (White indicator).
- **Other Users Incidents:**: Found the reportings other users on a forum, which I believe describe the same issue.

* **Environment:** OS – Linux (Kubuntu). Note: In this configuration, volume cannot be changed via OS, only physically on the device. No drivers installed (no drivers for Linux are provided by the manufacturer. Device just works after its plugging to the laptop). Device it not unplugged from the laptop (Laptop is used in a workstation mode, as a usual PC)
  **Frequency:** Two incidents recorded within a 6-month period on a single unit.

## Medical Case Study & Treatment Timeline

I suffered acute acoustic trauma.

- **Initial Shock:** Volume spike caused immediate "muffled" hearing and physical distress.
- **Day 1-3:** Significant hearing dullness. Patient initially waited for recovery.
- **Day 4-6:** Development of severe, "ultrasonic drilling" tinnitus, leading to insomnia.
- **Clinical Findings (2026-01-12):** Tonal audiometry showed results within the 0-20 dB range.
- **Conclusion:** Professional-grade hearing can be severely impaired even when standard tests show a "clinical norm".

### Treatment Protocol

- **Medication:** Started **Metypred** (Methylprednisolone) 8mg/day for 7 days, plus **Neurovit** and **Betaserc** (Betahistine) for long-term recovery.
- **HBOT (Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy):** 10 sessions (60 min each) at pressures ranging from **2.0 to 2.8 ATA**.
- - **Recovery Progress (as of Jan 29):** High-frequency "brightness" has largely returned. Tinnitus has softened into a manageable "white noise". Still suffering from the volume loss. Seems that I am getting adapted to this new norm, still hope for the full or near-full recovery.

## 🆘 EMERGENCY: WHAT TO DO IF THIS HAPPENS TO YOU

If your device just blasted your ears at 100% volume, act immediately. Every hour counts.

1. **Seek Medical Help ASAP:** Visit an ENT (Otolaryngologist) within 24–48 hours.
2. **Request Treatment:** Do not accept "wait and see" if you have tinnitus or muffled hearing, even if your audiogram is "normal".
3. **Inquire about HBOT:** Medical-grade hyperbaric oxygen therapy can be critical for hair cell recovery.
4. **Acoustic Rest:** Avoid all loud environments and headphones for at least 7 days.
5. **Secure Evidence:** Document the device state. Do not sell the faulty unit to avoid harming others.
